ouput files are:

1. CountsResults.csv
2. KiResults.csv
3. nai_disFreq.csv
4. nai_incFreq.csv
5. mem_fastFreq.csv
6. mem_slowFreq.csv

The first two files are the results of the total counts and Ki67 fractions for all four subsets under consideration. 
The last four files are the frequency of the TCR clones in each of  `naive displaceable`, `naive incumbent`, `memory fast`, and `memory slow` subsets.
